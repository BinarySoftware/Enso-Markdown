### To be further simplified and more user-friendly

# Enso Documentation Parser - Cheatsheet
### Tags
Starting from the top of the file, you can add tags.
There are 5 available tags : 
- DEPRECATED
- MODIFIED
- ADDED
- UPCOMING
- REMOVED

But if you make a mistake or type in unknown tag, parser will still run fine, producing
undefined tag called just like you've called it, ex. ALAMAKOTA

Furthermore you can add details to each tag by writing them right after tag declaration
with one space.

So if you want to declare tags, simply write them in uppercase on top of the file, before parser begins creation 
of other sections.

### Segments
Every time you create 2 newlines, parser will start a new text segment and close the previous one. 
The first segment you'll write will go to the `Synopsis` part of the document, rest will be in the `Body`.
Synopsis is there to write a small note for coder about what this function/library etc. does, body is to 
provide details.
There are 5 possible types of segments in Doc Parser:
 - Raw - which is just a text block
 - Important - To provide important details about functionality, known errors etc.
 - Info - Just what name suggests
 - Example - Placement for your usage examples, great place to add inline/multiline code 

And this is how you invoke them
 - Raw - created automatically after two newlines
 - Important - Just add `!` before the segment title
 - Info - Just add `?` before the segment title
 - Example - Just add `>` before the segment title
